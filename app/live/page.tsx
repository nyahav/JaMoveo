// Live Page:
// ● Show title with the song name and the author.
// ● Singers should see only the lyrics for the song.
// ● Other players should see both lyrics and chords for the song.
// ● Add a floating toggle button on the bottom to start/stop automatic
// slow scrolling down.
// ● Ensure a large font size and high contrast between background and
// text color, as there is a lot of smoke in the room.
// ● Only the admin can see the "Quit" button. Once clicked, all players,
// including the admin, move back to the main page.
